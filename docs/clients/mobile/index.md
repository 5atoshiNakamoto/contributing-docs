## Configure Git blame

We recommend that you configure git to ignore the Prettier revision:

```bash
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

## Android Development

See the [Android Mobile app](./android.md) page to set up an Android development environment.

## iOS Development

Unfortunately, iOS development requires provisioning profiles and other capabilities only available
to internal team members. We do not have any documentation for community developers at this time.
