Welcome! The Bitwarden Contributing Documentation contains all the information you need to get
started as a community developer.

## Getting Started

It’s likely the first thing you’ll need to do is set up a local development environment; to do so,
we recommend progressing through the documentation in the following order.

1. Install all the recommended [Tools and Libraries](./tools/index.md) for development.
2. Follow the [Server Setup Guide](./server/guide.md) to setup your local server and related
   services
3. Build and run each [Clients](./clients/index.md) from source and connect them to your local
   server
4. Read our [Contributing Guidelines](./contributing.md) and [Coding Style](./code-style/index.md)

## Help!

If you’re having trouble following these instructions, don’t panic.

- The [Bitwarden Help Center](https://bitwarden.com/help/) is an excellent resource to learn about
  the different features of our software and configuration options.
- Ask for help from the community in the [Community Forums](https://community.bitwarden.com)
- Ask the dev team on the official [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/bitwarden/Lobby)
